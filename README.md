Effective Accelerationism is a philosophical and political movement that emerged in the 1990s and 2000;

Effective accelerationism is a philosophy of life that aims to use 'Technocapital' as a way to optimize technological evolution, involving Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Automation, globally, autonomously, and expand it to its most cosmic form;

In short, e/acc is a movement in favor of maximizing technological evolution to its peak;

Due to the speed at which technology constantly evolves 24 hours a day, in such a short time, the movement has grown, generating trends such as **priv/acc (Privacy Accelerationism)** which is accelerationism in internet privacy;

But I have also noticed a need for acceleration in the area of cybersecurity, due to cases such as invasions of Web3 software programs, such as what happened with Binance and MetaMask Wallet;

That’s why the inspiration to develop the Security accelerationism aspect came about;

sec/acc involves being in favor of being a security provider for virtual protection in Web3 & Web4 environments in the Hacker world, using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, cybersecurity cannot be left out;

That's why I created this initiative and expanded it as a new community of Hackers in this new world, with people with experience and people new to the area, to create an ecosystem in this accelerationist movement;

The Cybersecurity focus areas will be:

- BlockChain
- IA
- Smart Contracts
- Bug Bounty
- Dapps
- DeFi Protocols
- Nodes

This way, this project will be constantly updated with many initiatives with a main focus on security.
